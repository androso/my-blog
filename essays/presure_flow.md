# On releasing pressure and the flow

Just as i’m writing this i felt the call, I realized i had something to talk about, i felt the need to share what i’m learning with the world. On my right i’m playing the opening of Blue Period and as i’m listening i remember multiple scenes:

and i ask myself: when was the last time i felt this way? that moment when all around you stops mattering, when you know there are hundreds of ways to get distracted yet you don’t care, you don’t give in, you have music playing and it is as if it’s stimulating you, not distracting, why did i stopped feeling this way? why did i accept less than this?

This is what people call ‘the zone’ or ‘the flow’. From wikipedia:

> In positive psychology, a flow state, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

From amjad masad:

> The leading expert on "flow," Csikszentmihályi, identified that for a human to enter this state, they need to be able to get direct and immediate feedback, for the problem to be well-defined, to have a balance between one's ability level and the challenge, and have a sense of control over the situation.

I’ve experienced this feeling, this state, a few times in my life. When i was writing my first story it was just me, an idea and my fingers writing, deleting, writing, deleting, thinking, thinking and so on.

I experienced it when i was taking [cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) and i had to solve the problem sets, they were a pain in the ass, i didn’t know how to solve them but i could spend hours trying to.

Not a single time when i was doing university homework. 

Is this something we can control? is this something you would like to control? why is it so hard to get? are there some universal set of requirements that we all can start working on? 

i don’t know the answers to these questions and because of that i charge you with the mission of examining your life, to ask yourself the big questions and be brave.

While i was writing this it became clear why i haven’t felt this way in such a long time. I’ve been putting too much pressure on myself. I’ve been in a rush, i’ve told myself for weeks (even months?) that i needed to do things fast else i was never going to make it. The mind needs space to think clear, to explore, to make mistakes... to live. We need to believe more in our potential.
